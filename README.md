## About the Project

This is a hotel booking application, that allows for hotel customers to book a room and view past, current, and future booking reservations. Upon successfully logging in, a guest is provided with a unique dashboard of their booking history and the total amount they have spent at the hotel. Guests can also search for available rooms, filter their search by room type, and book a room at the hotel. Upon booking a room, their dashboard view is updated to reflect their new booking and new total amount spent.

## Learning Goals 
1. Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
2. Ensure the application is following best accessibility practices.
3. Leverage Sass to DRY up CSS.
4. Build a robust test suite that tests happy/sad paths.
5. Make the application responsive so that content can be viewed on all devices.


## Future Iterations

1. Implement a staff or manager view/login. This manager view could show the hotel's revenue for that date, the number of rooms available that day, and the percent occupancy of the hotel. Furthermore they would be able to search through all the bookings and cancel a guest's booking.
2. There are opportunities to refactor this application, and create more reusable functions to DRY up code.
3. Add images and styling to the UI.
4. Adjust the date to reflect the user's timezone.
