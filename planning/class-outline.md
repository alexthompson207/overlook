Customer/User
- Any room bookings I have made (past or present/upcoming)
- The total amount I have spent on rooms


- I should be able to select a date for which Iâ€™d like to book a room for myself
- Upon selecting a date, I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
- I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
- I should be able to select a room for booking
- In the event that no rooms are available for the date/roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the user and asking them to adjust their room search
